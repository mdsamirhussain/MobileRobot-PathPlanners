# Path Planning Algorithms for Mobile Robots
 This repository contain "Path Planning Algorithms for Mobile Robots", a collection of popular algorithms written in Python, which is an integral aspect of robotic navigation and control. 

**The following algorithms included:**
- **RRT (Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees)**: A probablistic algorithm for efficiently exploring search spaces. Creates a rapidly growing tree by initalising a "root" of the tree, by randomly sampling the configuration space, finding feasible paths through complex and high-dimensional environment. This algorithm is great robotic systems such as robotic graspers which occupy higher dimensional environments then a mobile robot such as a rover.
- **RRT-Connect**: Similar to RRT, however instead builds a second tree to converge towards a solution quicker. One tree from the start node and another from the goal node, which eventually connect to form a complete path. Often quicker then RRT and less computationally taxing.
- **PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap)**: Randomly samples nodes in the configuration space and then constructs a graph by connecting the nodes. The sampling of nodes is carried out within a bounded configuration space, confined to a finite area of choice. Also contains collision detection algorithm within the code, to make sure the robot avoid obstacles. Once constructed a graph traversal algorithms such as Dijkstra's or A* algorithm can be used to query a path from the start node to the goal node within the graph.
- **PRM***: The optimal variant of the PRM algorithm, to find a more efficient path using a heuristic to guide the search by employing the A* algorithm.
